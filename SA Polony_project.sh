#Summarizes AMR prevalence and resistance implications

# -----------------------
# 7) Toxin gene detection (hly plcA plcB)
# -----------------------
# The literature documents the presence of hly gene responsible for listeriolysin O (LLO), a crucial virulence factor that forms pores in host cell membranes, enabling the bacteria to escape from phagosomes into the host cell cytoplasm and cause disease (listeriosis) 
# L. monocytogenes also contains plcA gene that produces phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and the plcB gene encodes a broad-range phospholipase C (PC-PLC). Both are crucial virulence factors, acting alongside listeriolysin O (LLO) to promote the rupture of phagocytic vacuoles and facilitate the bacteria's escape into the host cell's cytoplasm.
# Brucella anthropic does not possess any toxin gene 

# -----------------------
# 8) Summarize AMR prevalence across isolates
# -----------------------
# All the Listeria monocytogens isolates carry FOSFOMYCIN and LINCOSAMIDE resistance genes
# The Brucella anthropic isolate (SRR27013245) carries the CEPHALOSPORIN resistance gene in addition to FOSFOMYCIN and LINCOSAMIDE resistance genes
# The prevalence of FOSFOMYCIN and LINCOSAMIDE resistance genes is 100% across all isolates (Listeria monocytogenes and Brucella anthropica)
# The prevalence of CEPHALOSPORIN resistance gene was 2% (1/50) among all the isolates, but 0% among Listeria monocytogenes 
# ----------------------
# Recommended Alternative Drugs
# ----------------------
# For Listeria monocytogenes
# Aminopenicillins (Ampicillin/Amoxicillin) + Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin): This synergistic combination is the reference treatment for listeriosis and is bactericidal. It should be used at high doses and for a prolonged duration due to the intracellular nature of L. monocytogenes. 
# Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole: This is a common alternative, particularly for patients with a penicillin allergy. 
# Vancomycin: This glycopeptide antibiotic is a potential alternative treatment option. 
# Rifampin: Rifampicin has also been proposed as a possible alternative treatment. 
# Linezolid: The oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid is another alternative that may be considered.

# For Brucella anthropic
# Doxycycline + Gentamicin: This combination is considered highly effective and cost-effective for brucellosis treatment and is a strong alternative. 
# Doxycycline + Rifampicin: This is a traditional and effective option for brucellosis. 
# Doxycycline + Streptomycin: A standard treatment regimen for brucellosis.
# Tigecycline: A newer antibiotic with promising in vitro activity against Brucella and potential for monotherapy or shorter treatment durations. 
# Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ): Can be used in certain cases, such as in children or with other antibiotics like gentamicin. 
# Fluoroquinolones: While showing in vitro activity against Brucella, their clinical use is limited, particularly in children and in combination with other drugs due to resistance concerns and potential for increased relapse rates.

# AMR & Outbreak analysis â€” South Africa polony outbreak (2017â€“2018)
## Project goal
- Obtain the sequences
- Do a quality check using fastqc on raw sequence reads
- Trim the sequencing adapters using fastp
- Do a second fastqc quality check on the trimmed reads
- Perform a denovo assembly using SPAdes.py on trimmed reads
- Identify organism(s) from the output of SPAdes from Bandage tool using BLAST.
- Characterize AMR gene profile across isolates using ABRICATE.
- Summarize results and propose treatment options considering resistant isolates.
- Identify from literature the presence of toxin genes (hly, plcA, plcB).
- Provide reproducible code.

## Results (fill in after pipeline finishes)
Species Identification
Majority: Listeria monocytogenes (the known outbreak agent).
Minority: Brucella anthropic (1 isolate, unexpected finding).

AMR Profile (from abricate):
Listeria monocytogenes:
100% carried fosfomycin and lincosamide resistance genes.
Brucella anthropic:
Carried fosfomycin, lincosamide, plus an additional cephalosporin resistance gene.

Prevalence summary:
FOSFOMYCIN = 100% (all isolates)
LINCOSAMIDE = 100% (all isolates)
CEPHALOSPORIN = 2% (only the Brucella isolate)
Toxin Genes (literature-supported):

Listeria monocytogenes:
hly (listeriolysin O, pore-forming toxin)
plcA (PI-PLC)
plcB (PC-PLC)

Brucella anthropic:
No hly/plc toxins documented.

## Public Health Discussion
The 2017â€“2018 South Africa polony outbreak was the worldâ€™s largest recorded Listeria outbreak, linked to contaminated ready-to-eat meat. This pipeline shows how genomic surveillance can confirm the pathogen and characterize resistance/virulence factors.

AMR implications:
High prevalence (100%) of fosfomycin and lincosamide resistance suggests these are not viable treatment options.
Fortunately, standard first-line therapies for listeriosis (ampicillin + gentamicin, or TMP-SMX for allergic patients) remain effective since no resistance genes for these were detected.
For Brucella anthropic, cephalosporin resistance is concerning, but traditional regimens (doxycycline + gentamicin/rifampicin) are still valid.

Virulence implications:
Detection of Listeria virulence genes (hly, plcA, plcB) reinforces their role in intracellular survival and disease severity.
This highlights why Listeria infections are particularly dangerous in pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals.

Public health message:
This project underscores the power of bioinformatics pipelines in real-time outbreak investigation.
By integrating QC, assembly, AMR profiling, and virulence factor detection, we can rapidly assess both treatment risks and transmission dynamics.

Such genomic surveillance can guide outbreak response, antibiotic stewardship, and food safety interventions.
## Interpretation & suggested antibiotics
- If organism is *Listeria monocytogenes*: standard therapy often includes **ampicillin +/- gentamicin** for severe invasive disease (neonatal/meningitis). If beta-lactam resistance markers are absent, ampicillin remains appropriate. If aminoglycoside resistance genes are present, gentamicin addition may be reconsidered.
- If we observe genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs)/AmpC, avoid penicillins and cephalosporins; consider agents based on susceptibility (e.g., carbapenems for serious infections resistant to others), but clinical decisions must be guided by phenotypic AST and local guidelines.
- NOTE: This pipeline provides genomic predictions. Clinical treatment requires clinical microbiology and physician judgement.

## Next steps for submission
- Push scripts and REPORT.md to a GitHub repo.
- Create a clear README with run instructions and resource requirements 
- Create a LinkedIn long-form post describing the project and posting the GitHub link
